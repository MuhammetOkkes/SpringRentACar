# RentACar Backend Build
- I coded this project during the **Java Yazılım Geliştirici Yetiştirme Kampı** program organized by **Engin Demiroğ**. I would like to express my respect and gratitude to my instructor, **Engin Demiroğ**, for his contributions.

- In this project, we utilized Spring Boot to develop the backend of a RentACar application. Following a layered architecture and adhering to the principles of Object-Oriented Programming, we coded the project in a clean and organized manner.
